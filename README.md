### Abstract to unpublished paper: ###
This paper explores a sequential decision making methodology 
of when to update statistical learning models in Intelligent 
Edge Computing Devices given underlying changesin the 
contextual data distribution. The proposed model update 
scheduling takes into consideration the optimal decision
time for minimizing the network overhead while preserving
the prediction accuracy of the models. The paper reports on
a comparison between the proposed approach with four other
update delaying policies found in the literature, an 
evaluation of the performances using linear and support vector
regression models over real contextual data streams and a
discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed
policy.
